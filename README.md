> This is a submission for the 50 dollar grant from @hackclubs highway

Hi there, this is a cute camera that straps onto my dogs harness and allows me to make sure he is ok whilist I am on holiday! I spent about 6 hours designing and researching this and had a great time. It works using an ESP32 cam module. 

Here are some pictures of how it will look (top and botton):
