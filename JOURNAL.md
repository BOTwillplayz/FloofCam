Today I started on the CAD and it didn't go well! I did my CAD in fusion as I normally would, but as I imported the image I realised I made a fatal flaw... When I started I made my very first part of the sketch I made it 4cm with a 1mm tolerance and then worked around it, but the outer wall I made on the inside, so I have now had to restart.

I redesigned it and really love it!!! It will fit perfect on my dog (I thought *foreshadowing*)! I realised as I wias dozing off *zzzz* that there is no place in the floof cam that straps onto my dogs harness, so I figured that today I would need to redisgn add to design, so I went to bed. I woke up with a drive to finsh it so I came up with a design similar deisgn to a go-pro monut and concluded that my first design was done!
