**HOURS SPENT ON PROJECT: 7,95 Hours**

**25/06/19 Session 1 : 1 Hour long**
Today I started on the CAD and it didn't go well! I did my CAD in fusion as I normally would, but as I imported the image I realised I made a fatal flaw... When I started I made my very first part of the sketch I made it 4cm with a 1mm tolerance and then worked around it, but the outer wall I made on the inside, so I have now had to restart.

**25/06/19 Session 2 : 1.5 Hours// 25/06/20 Session 1 2 Hours**
I redesigned it and really love it!!! It will fit perfect on my dog (I thought *foreshadowing*)! I realised as I wias dozing off *zzzz* that there is no place in the floof cam that straps onto my dogs harness, so I figured that today I would need to redisgn add to design, so I went to bed. I woke up with a drive to finsh it so I came up with a design similar deisgn to a go-pro monut and concluded that my first design was done!

Ok maybe I lied, I did some test prints and it wasn't good.. There were 3 major issues:
1. The mount was terrible
2. The body wasn't big enough (it was like I tinnny little bit off)
3. It was to tall
so I fixed it all and am SOOO happy with it now... gonna reprint it and hopefully no more issues!!
